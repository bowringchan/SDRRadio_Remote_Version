# SDRRadio_Remote_Version
	An SDRRadio Server, transmits FM and AM audio by HLS via Internet.
	You can control the server via web browser remotely, also listening the radio remotely.
	The software is designed for only one user initially, but may evolved to be able to serve multiple users in one-master/multiple-guests mode.

	This is my graduation project. Hope to share it with the open source world as a gift. Lol
